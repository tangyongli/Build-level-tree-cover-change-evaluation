This is one record for project: Evaluating Building-Level Tree Cover Change in Southern California Wildland-urban Interface Using High-resolution Satellite Imagery
# Land Cover Mapping
+ We mapped 1 m land cover in Southern California WUI areas for years 2010 and 2022 using one attention-based CNNs model and NAIP Imagery.<br>

+ The model was trained on local machine and inferenced on  Google earth engine using matric operation. [GEE code](https://code.earthengine.google.com/189bc4ae2b4976ec607a2a5655f73ece?noload=1).<br> 
+ The mapping result is visible on the [web](https://ee-yl2022.projects.earthengine.app/view/wuilandcover). [GEE code](https://code.earthengine.google.com/467b3af170c64856340ea25aa8343f5a).
